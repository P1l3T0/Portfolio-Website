        <p>
          I'm a 21 year old student currently pursuing a degree in <strong>Computer Science </strong>
          at Technical University of Sofia. From an young age I've had an obsession with computers and how
          they function and that's how I got this passion for coding and wanting to create software for various purposes!
          <br />
          Currently I'm a software developer at Progress Software and so far it's been a blast!
        </p>
